## Reflection:
One of the main structural choices I made was including sidebar elements into the the actual content container instead of creating my own sidebar container and putting sidebar elements into that. I did this for one main reason: this way makes it easier to "put" sidebar elements in their right place positionally. With the sidebar container method, you'd have to use margins or <br> elements to manually create empty lines to "push" each sidebar element into their right place (which is not only a lot of work, but will also need to be changed everytime content is added to the page). The other general structural choices I made was using <h1> tags for titles, <h2> tags for section titles, and then <h3> for dividing sections into smaller bits. One way I would improve the site in the future is by adding a table of contents to the beginning of each webpage to make it easy for students to navigate throughout each module page.
